    There are two ways to write grib files, NCEP-style and ECMWF-style. In
NCEP-style, the numbers are rounded to integers after scaling the floats
by a power of 10.  To set the power, you must build the PDS with the
argument "P_dec_scale(N)".  To keep data to one place after the decimal,
you need to include the line:

  ex   pds = PDStool(pds,
        ...
        P_dec_scale(1),                 /* scale numbers by 10**1 */
        ...
        P_end);

The ECMWF-style, OTOH, rounds the number to an integer after scaling 
the number by a power of two.  Rather than specifying the power of two, 
the gribw routines determine the power of two that yields a specified 
binary precision.  For example, save the data with 16-bits precision, 
you must set the flags by

      set_BDSMaxBits(16);
      set_BDSMinBits(16);

before writing the grib data.
