The GDS, grid description section, of a GRIB file provides a complete
description of the grid being used.  The GDS is optional but is highly 
recommended, according to John Stackpole (NCEP Office Note 388).  If 
the GDS is missing, one has to determine the grid type from a center 
dependent grid identification code.  Of course, this plays havoc with 
GRIB reading code.  No one knows or wants to enter in every grid type 
from every center into their code.  Too much work and impossible to keep 
up to date.  Consequently a GDS should mandatory.  However, I don't run 
the world, and the GDS is optional.

When the GDS is missing, generic degribbing code will not work well.
Problems were found in GrADS v1.5.1.15 (linux) and wgrib v1.5.0a.
The program "add_NCEP_gds" will, as the name suggests, add a missing 
GDS to a NCEP GRIB file.  The program is restricted to NCEP files 
because I don't know the grid types for other centers.  Even if I did 
know, I'm not going to enter in the grid codes.  

This code was written using a preliminary version of the gribw library.


Compiling requires an ISO/ANSI C compiler.

       gcc -o add_NCEP_gds add_NCEP_gds.c      (gcc)
       acc -o add_NCEP_gds add_NCEP_gds.c      (Sun: acc is option)
       cc -o add_NCEP_gds add_NCEP_gds.c       (ISO/ANSI cc)
       cc -Aa -o wgrib all.c -lm               (hp: -Aa = ANSI C)
