apply_mask.txt

This is a program/procedure that I used to mask out "questionable" 
data.  This is an example of a practical use of gribw.


		How to applies a mask to a GRIB file

(1) Decode GRIB file along with header file

    wgrib -PDS10 -GDS10 oldgrib -d all -o oldbin >header

(2) Make a file with just the dates

    cut -f3 -d: <header >dates

(3) Fortran program (apply_mask.f) that reads (a) oldbin (b) dates 
    (c) mask and writes (a) newbin

(4) gribw -i newbin -o newgrib <header
