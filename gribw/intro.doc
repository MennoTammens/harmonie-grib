			Introduction to gribw

Gribw is a library for writing GRIB which is a WMO standard for
interchange of gridded fields.  GRIB is used by operational
meteorological centers, so if you want weather data on
grids, be prepared for GRIB data.  While GRIB is not perfect
it has several advantages over data formats.  The main advantages
are that the data are compressed, in a machine independent format,
self describing and many database manipulations can be done
without programing.


	Merging two databases:

		cat data.1.1.1997 data.1.2.1997 >data.1.1-2.1997

	Inventory

		wgrib {options} data.1.1.1997


	Extracting records to make a new database

		wgrib data.1.1.1997 -s | grep ":HGT:500 mb:" | \
			wgrib -i data.1.1.1997 -o data.1.1.1997.subset -grib


	Reordering records to make a new database

		wgrib data.1.1.1997 -s | {sort} |  \
			wgrib -i data.1.1.1997 -o data.1.1.1997.sorted -grib


	Extracting records and converting it into a text file

		wgrib data.1.1.1997 -s | grep ":HGT:500 mb:" | \
			wgrib -i data.1.1.1997 -o data.1.1.1997.txt -text


In our shop there was an effort to use a real database to store the
grib data.  Given our simple needs, a relational database is
overkill and wgrib was simple to use and sufficient.

Missing in the previous examples are creating GRIB files.

The primary disadvantages of GRIB are (1) compression is not optimal,
(2) encoding of the meta-data is often not general enough to allow
an accurate description of the data.  However, poor meta-data is
much perfered to your typical binary file which often a sequence of
floating point numbers.  (Gee whiz, the file size is not divizable by
12; therefore, it can't be 12 months of data.)
